<h2>Final Java Project for Programming Class</h2>

<h3>Connect 4 Game</h3>

Create a turn based game with a GUI, where players take turns dropping their marker into a column until either someone wins, or the board is full. 
Display the current player on each turn.
At the end of a game display the winner and ask if they want to play again.

<h3>INSTRUCTIONS:</h3>
On each turn, the display should show who the current player is.
The board should get filled from bottom to top just like in real life.
After a player drops their marker into the column of their choice, the program should check if he/she is a winner.
If the current player is a winner update the display label to reflect the status and ask if they want to play again.
Otherwise, the alternate player should take a turn.
If the board is full, check for a winner or a tie. Update the display label to reflect the status and ask if they want to play again.

<h3>EXTRA CREDIT:</h3>
Use image icons on the labels to display a marker when a slot is filled by a player taking a turn (5pts extra)
Create a ConnectX game so that the user can play connect4, or connect5, .. or connectX where they choose how many they would like to be in a row to be considered a “win” (15pts extra) - must check all diagonals

<h3>RESULT</h3>
